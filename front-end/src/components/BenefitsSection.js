                <h1>Why use this platform?</h1>
                <p>This isnâ€™t theory-heavy. Itâ€™s hands-on, visual, and made for builders.
                Youâ€™ll learn by example â€” not by scrolling through endless theory.
                Everything is visual and practical, crafted for both developers and designers.
                The platform plays perfectly with modern tools like React, Tailwind, and design systems.
                New tutorials, UI kits and components are added regularly to help you build faster and better.
